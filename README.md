## 🔮 Roadmap: Future Enhancements

We're excited about the future of **Lost & Found APP** and plan to implement the following features:

* **🗺️ Map Integration**: Display geo-tagged "Found" posts on a Google Maps interface, allowing users to easily locate nearby items.
* **🔔 Smart Notifications**: Implement a subscription system where users can follow categories and receive push notifications for relevant lost or found items in their vicinity.
* **🖼️ AI-Powered Matching**: Integrate on-device machine learning (TensorFlow Lite) to enable photo-based item matching, suggesting potential matches based on uploaded images.
* **☁️ Cloud Synchronization**: Utilize Firebase Firestore for secure cloud data storage, enabling multi-device access and a potential web dashboard for enhanced community support.
